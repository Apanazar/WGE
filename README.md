- **Drag-and-drop links** onto the canvas to bookmark and compare topics visually.

### 👩‍🎓 Ideal for Learners & Educators  
- **Visualize citation chains** in historical, scientific, or literary topics.  
- **Spot connection gaps**—see related articles you might otherwise miss.

### 🔍 Perfect for Researchers & Analysts

### 🛠 Solves Common Frustrations  
- No more copy/paste URL juggling—just click or drag to expand.  
- Banish endless “find in page” hunts; the graph shows links at a glance.  
- Avoid losing context: the side panel keeps article text alongside your map.  

### 🚀 Productivity Booster
